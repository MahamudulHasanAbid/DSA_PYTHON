Deleting Node 20

1. Initial Call:

*mum_tree.delete(20)".

Current node (self") is "17", Since " 20 > 17", move to the right subtree.

. Call "self.right.delete(20)".

2. First Recursive Call:

. Current node ( self") is " 20". This is the node to be deleted.

3. Find the Minimum in the Right Subtree:

The right subtree of " 20" is:
Copy code

23

.

The minimum value in this subtree is " 23".

4. Replace "20' with " 23":
. Set"self.data = 23',

5. Delete the Node with Value "23" in the Right Subtree:

. Call "self.right.delete(23)",

6. Deleting "23' in the Right Subtree:

. Current node (self") is " 23". This is the node to be deleted.

. "23' has one child (34").

7. Returning the Right Child:

. Since " 23" has no left child, return the right child ( 34").

This step ensures that the reference to the node * 23" in its parent node (which was " 20", now " 23"
after the value replacement) is set to * 34".

8. Updating References:

. At 20 (now "23"), "self.right" is updated to " 34".

9. Returning Up the Call Stack:

. Return the updated " 23" node to the previous call.

. At 17", "self.right" is updated with the retumed value.
